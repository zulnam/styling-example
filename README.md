Simple example of styling capabilities using only html and css

This repo is a simple html index page styled using css, with no 3rd party libraries or tools.

To run, simply open index.html with the browser of your choice (except Internet explorer no NEVER INTERNET EXPLORER).

Thank you.

## Notes
- Different fonts used due to being unable to find the ones on the website
- Design does not follow requirements 1:1 (spaces, mainly) due to having to style following a picture. Please send UX over for finishing touches
